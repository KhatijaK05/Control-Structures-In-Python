# Control-Structures-In-Python
This repository contains Python programs demonstrating basic conditional statements and loops. It includes two tasks: checking if a number is even or odd using an if-else statement, and calculating the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop. Both scripts show simple problem-solving in Python.
